# C-headerfile
User-defined header file with basic inbuilt functions in C language

Here We are providing a User-defined header file for efficient working of C programming.
This header file will be accessed in any software(Dev c++, turbo c, etc..) explicitly.
Primarly we need to put the header file in defalut header file location of every individual software.

#include "dizipyrates.h"
is the proper syntax to include user-defined header file.

Here Dizipyrates are an ingenious pack of people to work on different technical and non-technical projects.

help() function is used to list out the number of functions available in the header file.

You can use any of the function jsut calling the defined function name along with the appropriate arguments.
